Autophagy 
Sigma-1 receptor 
Randomized clinical trial 
a b s t r a c t 
Background: There are no approved oral disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD). 
Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess eÔ¨Écacy and safety of blarcamesine (ANAVEX¬Æ2-73), an 
orally available small-molecule activator of the sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) in early AD through restoration of 
cellular homeostasis including autophagy enhancement. 
Design: ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week Phase IIb/III trial. 
Setting: Multicenter - 52 medical research centers/hospitals in 5 countries. 
Intervention: 508 participants with early AD (Stage 3) were randomized to receive either blarcamesine ( n = 338) 
in medium dose group 30 mg or in high dose group 50 mg or placebo ( n = 170) oral capsules once daily for 48 
weeks. Participants in these groups were oÔ¨Äered to enroll into the open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD, 
which completed June 2024, ClinicalTrials.gov IdentiÔ¨Åer NCT04314934. 
Measurements: The co-primary cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed as change in ADAS-Cog13 and 
ADCS-ADL from baseline to 48 weeks. The outcomes include the secondary outcome CDR-SB and biomarkers 
from the A/T/N spectrum, plasma A ùõΩ42/40-ratio and global brain volume changes measured by MRI. All clinical 
endpoints were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), plasma biomarker measurements 
were analyzed by Welch‚Äôs t -test, and volumetric MRI scans were analyzed by general linear model. 
Results: Among 462 randomized participants in the intent-to-treat population (mean age, 73.7 years; 225 [48.7%] 
women), 338 (73.2%) completed the trial. The co-primary outcome was met under the multiplicity control rule, 
since the diÔ¨Äerences in the least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to 48 weeks between the prespeciÔ¨Åed 
blarcamesine and placebo groups for ADAS-Cog13 was signiÔ¨Åcant at a level of P < 0.025 and for CDR-SB was 
signiÔ¨Åcant at a level of P < 0.025, while ADCS-ADL did not reach signiÔ¨Åcance at Week 48 (ADAS-Cog13 diÔ¨Äer- 
ence of -2.027 [95% CI -3.522 to -0.533]; P = 0.008; CDR-SB diÔ¨Äerence of -0.483 [95% CI -0.853 to -0.114]; 
P = 0.010; ADCS-ADL diÔ¨Äerence of 0.775 [95%CI -0.874 to 2.423]; P = 0.357). Plasma A ùõΩ42/40-ratio increased 
signiÔ¨Åcantly with blarcamesine group vs. placebo, ( P = 0.048) and whole brain volume loss was signiÔ¨Åcantly 
decreased ( P = 0.002). Participants in the full safety population with ‚â• 1 serious treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) occurred in 56 participants (16.7%) in the blarcamesine and 17 (10.1%) in the placebo group. 
Common TEAEs included dizziness, which was transient and mostly mild to moderate in severity. One death in 
the blarcamesine group and 1 in the placebo group were both not considered treatment related. 
Conclusions: Blarcamesine, demonstrating a safety proÔ¨Åle with no associated neuroimaging adverse events, sig- 
niÔ¨Åcantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks with blarcamesine group as well as the individual 
30 mg (by 34.6%) and 50 mg (by 38.5%) blarcamesine groups vs. placebo on the prespeciÔ¨Åed primary cognitive 
endpoint ADAS-Cog13. The prespeciÔ¨Åed secondary endpoint CDR-SB, which is used as the sole primary endpoint 
in recent successful AD drug submissions, is signiÔ¨Åcantly improved at Week 48 with blarcamesine relative to 
placebo. The Ô¨Åndings are supported by biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, including plasma A ùõΩ42/40-ratio 
and reduction of whole brain atrophy. Additionally, the prespeciÔ¨Åed SIGMAR1 gene variant subgroup analysis 
conÔ¨Årmed beneÔ¨Åcial clinical eÔ¨Äect of blarcamesine group through upstream SIGMAR1 activation - subjects with 
the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant) expe- 
rienced an even greater signiÔ¨Åcant clinical beneÔ¨Åt with slowed clinical progression by 49.8% at 48 weeks on 
the prespeciÔ¨Åed primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. Oral once daily blarcamesine could represent a novel 
treatment in early AD and be complementary or alternative to anti-beta amyloid drugs. 
Introduction 
By 2050, 1 in 85 people worldwide will be diagnosed with 
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) [ 1 ]. At current estimates, approximately 60 
million persons are living with dementia worldwide [ 2 ], and this repre- 
sents a huge healthcare burden on patients, families and health systems 
worldwide. AD constitutes an estimated 60‚Äì80% of all dementias [ 3 ]. In 
the United States alone, health care and long-term care for people with 
AD and other dementias are projected to reach $1 trillion by 2050 (in 
2023 dollars) [ 3 ]. 
2S.Macfarlane,T.Grimmer,K.Teoetal. TheJournalofPreventionofAlzheimer‚ÄôsDisease12(2025)100016
The clinical and pathological presentation of AD is highly hetero- 
geneous [4] , being inÔ¨Çuenced by interactions between genotype, envi- 
ronment, cognitive reserve, and a range of demographic factors, among 
other determinants. Besides ùõΩ-amyloid and tau, which capture only a 
portion of the biological mechanisms underlying AD, there is a grow- 
ing appreciation for the co-occurrence of other concurrent pathologic 
insults, and an understanding that a more comprehensive or upstream 
approach is necessary to address the heterogeneous pathologies under- 
lying AD. Restoring cellular homeostasis through activation of an up- 
stream, endogenous pathway for clearing protein aggregates, including 
autophagy enhancement might be a promising approach with the poten- 
tial for broad application. It would also avoid the risk of serious compli- 
cations such as Amyloid Related imaging Abnormalities (ARIA) which 
can be life-threatening [5‚Äì7] . 
The overall mixed success of amyloid-targeting treatments [8‚Äì
11] and their potential for severe adverse events (AEs) [12,13] has high- 
lighted the need for safer eÔ¨Äective treatments. Complex logistical proce- 
dures and associated high costs of treatment mean there is still an unmet 
need for scalable, orally bioavailable lines of treatment. SIGMAR1 recep- 
tors are abundantly expressed in the brain [14] and SIGMAR1 agonists 
such as blarcamesine have demonstrated eÔ¨Äects in slowing neurodegen- 
erative diseases [15‚Äì17] . Therapies that safely reduce neurodegenera- 
tion in AD could be complementary or alternative to existing treatments. 
Blarcamesine (ANAVEX¬Æ2‚Äì73) is an oral drug candidate that re- 
stores cellular homeostasis by targeting SIGMAR1 and muscarinic recep- 
tors. Binding of SIGMAR1 agonists in the central nervous system (CNS) 
alters oligomeric forms of SIGMAR1 facilitating interaction with numer- 
ous client proteins to cause eÔ¨Äect [14,18,19] . Blarcamesine has demon- 
strated in-vivo ability to improve elderly immune systems by making 
cells more able to clear out their waste, in a process called autophagy 
enhancement [20] , and SIGMAR1 activation drives pro-survival path- 
ways including mitochondrial function [21] , lipid metabolism [22] , and 
the endoplasmic reticulum stress response [15] , all known to be relevant 
in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. The neuroprotec- 
tive cascade from SIGMAR1 activation may also reduce chronic disease 
related neuroinÔ¨Çammation [16] and provide an innate resistance to neu- 
rodegeneration [17] . 
Our Phase IIb/III trial in early AD sought to further our understand- 
ing on the safety and eÔ¨Écacy of blarcamesine in slowing disease pro- 
gression and reducing neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs 
disease. The trial hypothesis was that blarcamesine would have beneÔ¨Å- 
cial eÔ¨Äects on outcomes in the treatment of early AD. We report here key 
Ô¨Åndings from primary and secondary clinical and biomarker outcomes. 
Methods 
Study design 
The ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 trial was a Phase IIb/III 48-week random- 
ized, double-blind placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial of 
blarcamesine in early AD. After completion of the placebo-controlled 
48-week study, participants were oÔ¨Äered to enroll into a 96-week open 
label extension (OLE) study ATTENTION-AD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identi- 
Ô¨Åer NCT04314934), which completed in June 2024. The 48-week study 
was conducted at 52 sites across 5 countries; Australia (19 sites), United 
Kingdom (15 sites), Canada (10 sites), Germany (5 sites) and Nether- 
lands (3 sites) which enrolled 508 participants between August 27, 
2018, and June 28, 2022, with database lock on November 17, 2022 
(ClinicalTrials.gov IdentiÔ¨Åer: NCT03790709) [23] . Ethics review com- 
mittees and institutional review boards approved the study protocol at 
each study site. Written informed consent was obtained from study par- 
ticipants or legally authorized representatives prior to participating in 
the study. An independent data and safety monitoring board oversaw the 
safety of participants and reviewed safety data periodically throughout 
the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clin- 
ical Practice Guidelines, and local regulatory and ethics requirements. 
Participants 
Patients aged 60 to 85 years who met the National Institute on Ag- 
ing (NIA) ‚ÄìAlzheimer‚Äôs Association 2011 criteria for diagnosis of early- 
stage mild dementia due to AD or mild cognitive impairment due to 
AD [24‚Äì26] were eligible to participate in this study, with one of the 
following additional criteria required to support a diagnosis of AD: (a) 
historic or current record of CSF assessment compatible with AD, cut 
oÔ¨Ävalues of amyloid beta (A ùõΩ)42 < 1054 pg/mL, total Tau (tTau) > 213 
pg/mL, phosphorylated Tau (pTau) > 21.3 pg/mL, and A ùõΩ42/A ùõΩ40 ratio 
< 0.064 or CSF pTau181 > 27 pg/mL (irrespective of the A ùõΩ42/A ùõΩ40 ra- 
tio) by automated Elecsys¬ÆCSF biomarkers assays (Roche Diagnostics) 
or comparable commercially used CSF assays, or (b) historic record of 
PET scan (amyloid scan or FDG-PET) within 36 months of screening, or 
(c) historic CT or MRI scan within 18 months of screening consistent 
with a diagnosis of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease [24‚Äì26] . A Mini-Mental state 
examination (MMSE) score of 20 to 28 at the screening and randomiza- 
tion visits [27] and a Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) 
recall score of ‚â§ 17 or total recall score < 40 were also required [28,29] . 
Patients on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or other cognitive enhancing 
medications such as memantine, supplements, or nutraceuticals used to 
treat early AD were required to remain on stable doses for at least 90 
days prior to screening. A complete Ô¨Çowchart of patient screening and 
enrollment is provided as Fig. 1 . 
Study outcome measures were obtained at baseline study entry and 
at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48. MRI assessments and blood draws for plasma 
AD pathophysiologic biomarkers were obtained at baseline study entry 
and Week 48. 
Randomization and intervention 
Randomization was performed by a third-party company using a pro- 
prietary validated and ISO certiÔ¨Åed program. The randomization code 
was generated on a remote server and randomized patients by assigning 
and shuÔ¨Ñing blocks representing assigned treatment groups and ran- 
domization parameters, using a base block size of six. For each enrolled 
subject, at the time of enrollment, site staÔ¨Äentered the subject‚Äôs infor- 
mation into the randomization server, which automatically randomized 
the subject and assigned an anonymized ID. Prior to unblinding, the 
data were only accessible to the third-party logistics team and selected 
members of the development team for programming purposes. All par- 
ticipants, care providers, investigators, data analysis team members, and 
other related personnel were blinded for the duration of the study. 
Study participants were randomized to receive a daily oral dose of 
either placebo or blarcamesine at consistent timepoints relatively early 
in the morning with target dose of 30 mg or 50 mg daily for 48 weeks 
(ratio 1:1:1) in a Ô¨Çexible treatment titration design. At the start of the 
study participants underwent a 2-week treatment titration period which 
was modiÔ¨Åed in a protocol amendment to 3 weeks; over this period the 
treatment was up-titrated each week to the assigned target dose, main- 
taining blinding of treatment and dose. Irrespective of the target dose, 
the study protocol allowed for dose down titration, which was permit- 
ted for any reason, and similarly during the maintenance period when 
participants were required to maintain a minimum dose of 10 mg, re- 
sulting in the two active treatment groups receiving relatively similar 
treatment doses over the course of the study regardless of their initially 
assigned target dose. (Supplemental Table 1) Following the study ratio- 
nale, the two active arms were analyzed separately and also combined 
to form a single active blarcamesine group and compared with placebo 
in the analysis. The single blarcamesine group vs placebo will be the pri- 
mary analysis. The two separated arms vs placebo provide the support 
evidence.

Outcomes 
Clinical endpoints 
The co-primary outcomes were reduction in cognitive decline as- 
sessed from baseline over 48 weeks with blarcamesine compared 
to placebo using the 13-item Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale- 
Cognition (ADAS-Cog13), and reduction in decline of the ability to per- 
form daily activities assessed from baseline over 48 weeks with blar- 
camesine compared to placebo using the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Coopera- 
tive Study ‚ÄìActivities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Scale [23] . 
The secondary outcome was the reduction in cognitive and func- 
tional decline assessed from baseline over 48 weeks with blarcamesine 
compared with placebo using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum 
of Boxes (CDR-SB) [23,30,31] . 
One exploratory clinical endpoint speciÔ¨Åed in the protocol was also 
analyzed: the questionnaire-based Clinical Global Impression ‚ÄìImprove- 
ment (CGI-I) scale. 
Plasma A ùõΩ42/A ùõΩ40 ratio and plasma Nf-L, p-Tau (181), and p-Tau (231) 
biomarker endpoints 
Analysis of biomarkers for available blood specimens was conducted 
using single molecule array immunoassay (SIMOA HD-X), enzyme- 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or enzyme-linked lectin assay 
(ELLA) technology depending on the analyte. 
As exploratory biomarker eÔ¨Écacy endpoints, plasma levels of A ùõΩ40 
and A ùõΩ42 were quantiÔ¨Åed at baseline and Week 48 by ELISA and used 
to calculate A ùõΩ42/A ùõΩ40 ratio, an established indicator of amyloid beta 
deposition in the brain. Plasma levels of neuroÔ¨Ålament light chain (Nf- 
L), p-Tau (181), and p-Tau (231) were quantiÔ¨Åed by SIMOA HD-X at 
baseline and Week 48 as exploratory biomarker eÔ¨Écacy endpoints. 
MRI biomarker endpoints 
As an additional biomarker eÔ¨Écacy endpoint, structural MRI scans 
were performed at baseline and Week 48 and used to quantify changes in 
brain volume over the course of the study. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, based on 3D T1- 
weighted images, volumes of whole brain, total white matter, total grey 
matter, and lateral ventricles were quantiÔ¨Åed and analyzed in terms of 
annualized percent change from baseline. EÔ¨Écacy was evaluated as the 
reduction of brain volume decrease compared to placebo, while eÔ¨Écacy 
for lateral ventricles was evaluated as the reduction of brain cavities 
(Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Ålled structures) volume increase compared to placebo. 
SIGMAR1 gene variant genotyping [common SIGMAR1 gene (WT) and 
variant (rs1800866)] 
As a prespeciÔ¨Åed exploratory endpoint of the study, clinical eÔ¨Écacy 
measurements were compared for subgroups based on absence or pres- 
ence of a SIGMAR1 gene variant (rs1800866 T > G missense variant) to 
assess the impact of this genetic variant on clinical eÔ¨Écacy. The com- 
mon SIGMAR1 allele for the rs1800866 variant is T, the WT = Wild Type 
( ‚àº80%‚àí 70% of the general population), while ‚àº20%‚àí 30% of the gen- 
eral population carry the G allele, the mutated SIGMAR1 gene variant 
[32] . 
Sample size calculation 
Sample size and power calculations were based on a simulation 
approach with several planned scenarios and assuming co-primary 
endpoints (ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-ADL). The sample size calculation 
assumes the mean diÔ¨Äerence between either blarcamesine arm and 
placebo of 1.5 points (SD = 4.5) in the ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL with at 
least 90% power using a two-sample t -test with alpha = 0.05 (2-sided). 
For the calculation of power concerning co-primary endpoints, conser- 
vatively assuming that power can be independently calculated [33] , this 
will achieve at least 80% power for two endpoints. A 33% dropout rate 
was considered in estimating the sample size based on earlier studies. 
Therefore, 509 participants would need to be enrolled to allow for an 
anticipated 342 completers, i.e., 228 patients per combined treatment 
and 114 per placebo arm, respectively. 
Statistical analyses 
Statistical analyses were done with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) 
or R Project version 4.2.3 (R Foundation). 
Analysis of clinical endpoints 
The study protocol prespeciÔ¨Åed the reduction in decline assessed 
from baseline over 48 weeks with blarcamesine compared to placebo for 
the respective co-primary (ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-ADL) and secondary 
4S.Macfarlane,T.Grimmer,K.Teoetal. TheJournalofPreventionofAlzheimer‚ÄôsDisease12(2025)100016
(CSR-SB) endpoints using the mixed eÔ¨Äects model. Hence, all prespec- 
iÔ¨Åed clinical endpoints, including ADAS-Cog13, ADCS-ADL, CDR-SB, 
and CGI-I were analyzed using a linear mixed model (mixed model for 
repeated measures; MMRM). The MMRM analysis method is the con- 
vention used for regulatory Ô¨Ålings and was used as the primary analy- 
sis method in all recent regulatory decisions for aducanumab [5] and 
lecanemab [7] , as well as donanemab [6] with similar speciÔ¨Åcations. 
Primary and secondary analyses were carried out in the protocol- 
speciÔ¨Åed analysis population, the ‚Äúintent-to-treat ‚Äù (ITT) population, 
which corresponds to what is typically termed ‚ÄúmodiÔ¨Åed intent-to-treat ‚Äù
(mITT) and was deÔ¨Åned as all randomized patients who received at least 
one study dose and had at least one post-dose clinical measurement. 
The change of clinical scores from baseline to Week 48 was ana- 
lyzed as the dependent variable, with treatment and visit week as Ô¨Åxed 
eÔ¨Äects, treatment-by-visit as interaction eÔ¨Äect, and baseline score, coun- 
try, baseline concomitant AD medication, natural logarithm of the base- 
line plasma Nf-L concentration, baseline MMSE status, and SIGMAR1 
receptor gene variant genotype status (single-nucleotide polymorphism 
SIGMAR1 rs1800866 presence or absence) as covariates in the model. 
For CGI-I, baseline CGI-S score was used as baseline. The primary com- 
parison was the contrast (diÔ¨Äerence in the least squares mean) between 
blarcamesine and placebo at the last visit (Week 48), which was per- 
formed for the active treatment group as well as separately for the as- 
signed (30 mg and 50 mg) treatment groups. For the primary analysis, 
the model assumed the missing data to be missing at random without 
imputation. 
Analyses of plasma biomarkers 
The plasma biomarker endpoints were assessed at the baseline and 
the end of the study (Week 48). Statistical signiÔ¨Åcance was assessed with 
a t -test, using a signiÔ¨Åcance threshold of p < 0.05 (‚àó ), p < 0.01 (‚àó ‚àó ), or 
p < 0.001 (‚àó ‚àó ‚àó ). Considering the heterogeneity presented in these data 
sets, a Welch‚Äôs unequal variance option was used. 
Analysis of MRI biomarkers 
All imaging processing was performed blind to participant 
group allocation (treatment or placebo). MRI data from base- 
line and Ô¨Ånal visit (48 weeks) were analyzed using QyScore¬Æ
[34,35] ( www.qynapse.com/qyscore ). QyScore¬Æ is intended for auto- 
matic labelling, visualization and volumetric quantiÔ¨Åcation of brain 
structures and lesions from MR images. 
3D T1-weighted images were processed through the QyScore¬Æwork- 
Ô¨Çow [34] . Within this workÔ¨Çow, images were processed through Statis- 
tical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12) [36] , which includes bias 
Ô¨Åeld correction to correct for inhomogeneities in the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, and 
segmentation into three tissue classes: grey matter, white matter, and 
cerebrospinal Ô¨Çuid. For each subject, overall volumes were produced 
and exported for regions including Whole Brain Volume (combined to- 
tal grey matter and white matter volumes), Whole Brain White Matter, 
and Whole Brain Grey Matter. The Lateral Ventricles were segmented 
using an implementation of a 3D U-Net deep learning segmentation al- 
gorithm (called BGCVBS) [37] . 
The least-squares mean treatment diÔ¨Äerence of the annualized per- 
cent change MRI data was analyzed using a general linear model with 
adjustments for treatment group, baseline volume, and baseline MMSE 
status. 
Safety objectives - adverse events 
Safety objectives were evaluated by the incidence of AEs and seri- 
ous AEs in the full safety population for both active and placebo groups 
and were summarized according to event frequency by treatment as- 
signment. 
Missing data 
For the primary analysis, the MMRM model assumed the missing 
data was missing at random without imputation. The missing data for 
MMRM analyses were handled by the likelihood base mixed eÔ¨Äect model 
and the eÔ¨Écacy parameters were estimated by incorporating all the ob- 
servations. 
Sensitivity analysis 
The primary analyses assume that missing eÔ¨Écacy assessments are 
missing at random (MAR). To assess the robustness of the primary anal- 
yses, a tipping point analysis under missing not at random (MNAR) as- 
sumption was conducted for ADAS-Cog13. In this analysis, 100 datasets 
were Ô¨Årst generated with assumptions of MAR using SAS PROC MI. The 
missing not at random was realized by worsening imputed values in the 
active arm with increment of 0.02. or by improving imputed values in 
placebo arm with increment of 0.04. The primary MMRM model was 
applied to each of the 100 worsening or improving datasets. With each 
incremental change, these results from imputed data were combined us- 
ing Rubin‚Äôs combination rules, with SAS PROC MIANALYZE. The process 
stops when the primary model result is no longer signiÔ¨Åcant. 
Results 
Of 988 participants screened, 508 were enrolled and randomized, 
and among 462 randomized participants in the ITT population (mean 
age, 73.7 years; 225 [48.7%] women), 338 (73.2%) completed the trial. 
338 were assigned to receive blarcamesine and 170 were assigned to re- 
ceive placebo ( Fig. 1 ). Baseline characteristics of the ITT population are 
summarized by blarcamesine group ( n = 298), assigned to 30 mg group 
( n = 154), assigned to 50 mg group ( n = 144), and placebo ( n = 164) 
group ( Table 1 ). Due to the prespeciÔ¨Åed Ô¨Çexible dosing design of the 
study, the 30 mg and 50 mg assigned dosage arms reached quite similar 
average cumulative exposure at each study visit (Supplementary Table 
1); hence the combined blarcamesine group vs placebo is the primary 
analysis and supported by the comparison of separated dose groups 
vs placebo. Study drug compliance (actual days of exposure/planned 
days of exposure) was high, with a mean of 96% in the combined blar- 
camesine group and 99% in the placebo group. Most enrolled partic- 
ipants would be characterized as early AD (Stage 3) [38] with base- 
line MMSE score 20‚Äì28, and the majority were on background ther- 
apy of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and/or memantine to treat AD 
( Table 1 ). Baseline AD status was further supported by the elevated base- 
line levels of plasma p-Tau (181) and p-Tau (231), which conÔ¨Årmed AD 
pathology for participants, consistent with abnormal CSF amyloid-beta 
status in previous studies [39] . 
Clinical endpoint results are reported in Table 2 in terms of improve- 
ment from baseline at Week 48, with the results per visit plotted in Fig. 2 ; 
results for assigned 30 mg and 50 mg groups are plotted in Supplemental 
Figure 1. For the primary endpoint ADAS-Cog13, blarcamesine group is 
signiÔ¨Åcantly better than placebo (mean diÔ¨Äerence vs. placebo ‚àí 2.027 
[95%CI‚àí 3.522 to‚àí 0.533]; P = 0.008), representing a 36.3% reduction 
in clinical decline at 48 weeks. Similar results vs. placebo were observed 
for both 50 mg blarcamesine (diÔ¨Äerence of ‚àí 2.149 [95%CI ‚àí 3.979 to 
‚àí 0.319]; P = 0.021), representing a 38.5% reduction in clinical decline 
at 48 weeks; and for 30 mg blarcamesine dosage groups (diÔ¨Äerence of 
‚àí 1.934 [95%CI ‚àí 3.639 to ‚àí 0.228]; P = 0.026), representing a 34.6% 
reduction in clinical decline at 48 weeks. Co-primary endpoint ADCS- 
ADL improved for blarcamesine-treated patients relative to placebo but 
did not reach statistical signiÔ¨Åcance at 48 weeks. The secondary end- 
point CDR-SB was signiÔ¨Åcantly improved for blarcamesine group vs. 
placebo (diÔ¨Äerence of‚àí 0.483 [95%CI‚àí 0.853 to‚àí 0.114]; P = 0.010), 
representing a 27.6% reduction in clinical decline at 48 weeks. SigniÔ¨Å- 
cant improvement from placebo was also observed for both 50 mg (dif- 
ference of ‚àí 0.465 [95%CI ‚àí 0.918 to ‚àí 0.012]; P = 0.045) and 30 mg 
(diÔ¨Äerence of‚àí 0.502 [95%CI‚àí 0.924 to‚àí 0.080]; P = 0.020) assigned 
dose groups. CGI-I was signiÔ¨Åcantly improved in the active treatment 
group vs. placebo (diÔ¨Äerence of ‚àí 0.278 [95% CI ‚àí 0.466 to ‚àí 0.089]; 
P = 0.004), as well as both 50 mg (diÔ¨Äerence of‚àí 0.314 [95%CI‚àí 0.545

The relatively weaker eÔ¨Äect of blarcamesine compared to placebo 
at the Ô¨Årst time point (Week 12) is mostly related to initial tolerabil- 
ity caused by a relatively steep up titration and is most pronounced in 
ADCS-ADL and CDR-SB scores in the 50 mg dose groups (Supplemen- 
tal Figure 1), suggesting there is a temporary functional weakening as 
patients adjust to higher doses during and after titration in the ITT pop- 
ulation. Blarcamesine and placebo groups had 72 (75%) and 16 (57.2%) 
patient discontinuations in this early titration phase on or before Week 
24, primarily due to TEAEs (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Fig- 
ure 2). 40 (41.7%) blarcamesine patients and 5 (17.9%) placebo pa- 
tients dropped out on or before the Ô¨Årst analysis visit (Week 12). Even 
when early termination patients were excluded, the placebo group per- 
formed better than the blarcamesine group in these early phases (includ- 
ing Week 12) (Supplemental Figure 3). Therefore, there is no evidence 
that early termination will introduce a bias in favor of blarcamesine. 
Consistent with a reduction of amyloid beta burden in the brain, 
plasma A ùõΩ42/40 ratio increased signiÔ¨Åcantly in blarcamesine-treated 
patients compared to placebo (mean diÔ¨Äerence vs. placebo (95% CI) of 
+ 0.013 (0.000 to 0.026), P = 0.048) with blarcamesine-treated patients 
increasing ( + 0.013) and placebo patients decreasing slightly (‚àí 0.0003) 
from baseline to week 48 (Supplemental Figure 4, Supplemental Table 
3). Similarly, plasma levels of Nf-L, p-Tau (181), and p-Tau (231) all 
showed a smaller increase in blarcamesine-treated patients compared 
to placebo, although not reaching statistical signiÔ¨Åcance (Supplemental 
Table 3). 
Physical signs of neurodegeneration were also reduced in the blar- 
camesine treatment group, with structural MRI scans showing a signiÔ¨Å- 
cant reduction in whole brain grey matter volume loss, and correspond- 
ing decrease in the enlargement of lateral ventricles, in the active treat- 
ment group as well as both 30 mg and 50 mg treatment groups, com- 
pared with placebo (Supplemental Table 4, Supplemental Figure 5). Vol- 
ume change of Whole Brain White Matter was not signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent 
between treatment groups. 
Clinical eÔ¨Écacy analysis of SIGMAR1 gene variant (rs1800866) sub- 
groups by MMRM demonstrated that variant non-carriers (common SIG- 
MAR1 wild-type carriers; n = 199/101 blarcamesine/placebo) have a 
stronger response to blarcamesine treatment (Supplemental Tables 5 
and 6) for ADAS-Cog13 (blarcamesine group vs. placebo diÔ¨Äerence of 
‚àí 2.317 [95% CI ‚àí 4.182 to ‚àí 0.453], 49.8% less decline, P = 0.015) 
and CDR-SB (blarcamesine group vs. placebo diÔ¨Äerence of ‚àí 0.601 
[95%CI‚àí 1.070 to‚àí 0.133], 33.7% less decline, P = 0.012) compared to 
the results for the SIGMAR1 gene variant rs1800866 carrier subgroup 
( n = 87/58 blarcamesine/placebo): ADAS-Cog13 blarcamesine group vs. 
placebo (diÔ¨Äerence of ‚àí 1.593 [95% CI ‚àí 4.174 to 0.989], 25.2% less 
decline, P = 0.225); CDR-SB (diÔ¨Äerence of ‚àí 0.230 [95% CI ‚àí 0.826 to 
0.367], 13.6% less decline, P = 0.449).

The tipping point analysis was performed under the missing not at 
random (MNAR) assumption (Supplemental Table 7). For ADAS-Cog13, 
placebo patients need to improve by 3.3 points, or blarcamesine patient 
worsening 1.9 points, from the imputed data under MAR to overturn the 
result of the primary analysis under MAR assumption. As the observed 
treatment diÔ¨Äerence is‚àí 1.973, this result supports the robustness of the 
MAR assumption in the primary analysis. 
One death (0.6%) occurred in placebo group, and one death (0.3%) 
occurred in the blarcamesine group. No deaths were considered by the 
investigators to be related to assigned treatment. At least one serious 
AE occurred in 10.1% of the placebo group and in 16.7% of the blar- 
camesine group ( Table 3 ). The proportion of participants with one or 
more treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) was 76.8% in placebo group and 
96.7% in blarcamesine group; the TEAEs were predominantly mild or 
moderate. 
The most common blarcamesine AEs (5% or more) during treatment 
titration were dizziness (placebo 6.0%, blarcamesine 35.8%) and con- 
fusional state (placebo 0.6%, blarcamesine 14.3%) ( Table 3 ). During 
treatment maintenance, the most common AEs were dizziness (placebo 
5.6%, blarcamesine 25.2%) and confusional state (placebo 2.5%, blar- 
camesine 13.3%). The events of dizziness and confusional state were 
transient and predominantly mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). TEAEs led 
to treatment and study discontinuation in 7.1% of placebo and 32.2% 
of blarcamesine groups ( Table 3 ). Early terminations in the active treat- 
ment group occurred predominantly before the Ô¨Årst post-baseline sched- 
uled analysis visit at Week 12 (Supplemental Table 2) mostly related to 
the relatively steep up titration to the respective target doses. No trend 
of serious or life-threatening adverse events was observed in the active 
treatment group. 
Discussion 
In this Phase IIb/III randomized clinical trial, blarcamesine signiÔ¨Å- 
cantly slowed clinical progression at 48 weeks in the ITT population of 
participants with early AD for the cognitive primary endpoint ADAS- 
Cog13 and for the composite cognitive/functional secondary endpoint 
CDR-SB, while the co-primary endpoint ADCS-ADL did not reach statis- 
tical signiÔ¨Åcance at Week 48. The co-primary outcome was met under 
the multiplicity control rule, since the diÔ¨Äerences in the least-squares 
mean (LSM) change from baseline to 48 weeks between the prespec- 
iÔ¨Åed blarcamesine and placebo groups for ADAS-Cog13 was signiÔ¨Å- 
cant at a level of P < 0.025 and for CDR-SB was signiÔ¨Åcant at a level 
of P < 0.025. In addition, current regulatory guidance from the FDA 
suggests that a sole cognitive endpoint is suÔ¨Écient for demonstrating 
signiÔ¨Åcance in early AD study populations [38] . In keeping with cur- 
rent regulatory practice, blarcamesine met the primary endpoint and 
should be considered a win as measured by ADAS-Cog13 at Week 48. 
The clinical eÔ¨Äect of blarcamesine was supported by two independent 
biomarkers: a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in pathological amyloid beta lev- 
els in plasma, representing a decrease in pathological amyloid beta in 
the brain, as well as a signiÔ¨Åcant slowing in the rate of pathological 
brain atrophy in the brain as measured by MRI. Improvement in plasma

A ùõΩ42/A ùõΩ40 ratio with blarcamesine treatment, as would be consistent 
with a reduction in amyloid beta in the brain is not entirely unexpected, 
as the Sigma-1 receptor and SIGMAR1 agonists are known to modu- 
late the eÔ¨Äects of amyloid precursor protein as well as amyloid-beta 
oligomers to reduce neurotoxicity [40] . In addition to the ability of 
blarcamesine to reduce cognitive impairments in amyloid beta AD mod- 
els, blarcamesine signiÔ¨Åcantly prevented amyloid beta-induced cogni- 
tive deÔ¨Åcits with conÔ¨Årmed biomarker-responses in an animal model of 
AD [40] . 
All clinical endpoints demonstrated improvement in the blarcame- 
sine treated group as well as the 30 mg and 50 mg blarcamesine groups 
at 48 weeks: general cognitive score (ADAS-Cog13), clinical dementia 
rating (CDR-SB), and global clinical improvement (CGI-I) all reached 
statistical signiÔ¨Åcance, while the functional outcome ADCS-ADL im- 
proved but did not reach full signiÔ¨Åcance. A possible explanation is 
that the ADCS-ADL scale is designed for AD with overt dementia and is 
less sensitive for early AD; recent studies comparing ADCS-ADL to other 
functional scoring outcomes suggest it may not be the most sensitive for 
early AD [41] , and trials for donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine 
have all reported statistically signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerences in ADCS-ADL vs. 
placebo for subjects with moderate-to-severe AD but did not observe 
any signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerences in mild AD [42] . At 48 weeks, blarcame- 
sine group demonstrated numerically superior clinical eÔ¨Écacy com- 
pared with recent anti-amyloid therapies even within a shorter treat- 
ment duration; ADAS-Cog13 diÔ¨Äerence of‚àí 2.027 at 48 weeks vs.‚àí 1.35 
reported for Kisunla/donanemab at 76 weeks [6] , and CDR-SB diÔ¨Äer- 
ence of‚àí 0.483 at 48 weeks vs.‚àí 0.451 reported for Leqembi/lecanemab 
at 72 weeks [7] . Recent regulatory actions on anti-amyloid mAb drug 
trials [5‚Äì7] were made with CDR-SB serving as the sole primary end- 
point; when assessing CDR-SB, blarcamesine demonstrates signiÔ¨Åcant 
improvement over placebo in the active treatment group as well as both 
the 30 mg and 50 mg dosage groups. The physician-evaluated global 
endpoint Clinical Global Impression ‚ÄìImprovement (CGI-I) also demon- 
strated signiÔ¨Åcant improvement over placebo at 48 weeks in the active 
treatment group as well as both 30 mg and 50 mg blarcamesine dosage 
groups, as further support of eÔ¨Écacy in this study population. Taken as 
a whole, the clinical endpoints demonstrate eÔ¨Écacy based on current 
regulatory standards for early AD, and the magnitudes of the clinical 
eÔ¨Äects are numerically superior to recently approved therapies for early 
AD. 
Blarcamesine treatment was associated not only with slowing of pro- 
gression in cognitive decline but also with amelioration of key indica- 
tors of AD pathology, namely increase in plasma A ùõΩ42/A ùõΩ40 ratio and 
reduction in brain volume loss. Plasma A ùõΩ42/40 ratio has been con- 
sistently shown to be a reliable measure for amyloid plaque deposition 
[43] and so a substantial increase in plasma A ùõΩ42/40 ratio is a strong in- 
dicator that amyloid plaque burden may be decreasing in blarcamesine- 
treated patients. This current clinical study has now strengthened the 
previously reported [40] link between blarcamesine and AD pathophys- 
iology. Taken together, these results suggest a potential relationship be- 
tween blarcamesine treatment and plasma levels of these proteins, as 
well as the A/T/N framework for AD pathology. 
The results of the prespeciÔ¨Åed SIGMAR1 gene variant subgroup 
analysis reinforce the previously conÔ¨Årmed (from the earlier published 
Phase 2a AD study [18] ) mechanism of action for blarcamesine in 
AD, beneÔ¨Åcial clinical eÔ¨Äect through upstream SIGMAR1 activation. 
Compared to the full ITT population, subjects without the mutated 
SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant (common SIGMAR1 wild-type carriers; 
n = 199/101 blarcamesine/placebo) treated with blarcamesine expe- 
rienced a greater clinical beneÔ¨Åt for both ADAS-Cog13 (slowed clinical 
progression by 49.8% vs. 36.3%) and CDR-SB (slowed clinical progres- 
sion by 33.7% vs. 27.6%). Conversely, the subgroup of subjects carrying 
the SIGMAR1 rs1800866 mutation ( n = 87/58 blarcamesine/placebo) 
who were treated with blarcamesine did not reach signiÔ¨Åcance in any 
reported clinical endpoints relative to placebo. The conÔ¨Årmed SIGMAR1 
gene variant data might allow the possibility of utilizing the SIGMAR1 
rs1800866 SNP as a stratiÔ¨Åcation biomarker (enriching common SIG- 
MAR1 wild-type carriers by excluding SIGMAR1 rs1800866 mutation 
carriers) eÔ¨Äectively to stratify patients within the precision medicine 
paradigm. 
The study had some missing data. 45 out of 462 ITT patients discon- 
tinued on or before reaching Week 12, the Ô¨Årst analysis visit. Among 
these patients, 40 were in the blarcamesine group, and 36 dropped out 
due to TEAEs. The missing data in the study dropouts were primarily due 
to patients who did not tolerate the relatively short and steep titration 
schedule of this study. There is no evidence that these patients intro- 
duced a bias in favor of the blarcamesine group by dropping out early. 
Going forward, the titration schedule can be adjusted to slower titration 
and lower target dose. 
To our knowledge this is the Ô¨Årst report of a therapeutic agent for 
AD that has demonstrated an attenuation in global brain volume loss 
measured by MRI and reduction of the expansion of the lateral ven- 
tricular volume compared to placebo. Volumetric MRI improvements 
associated with blarcamesine appeared global and may be in response 
to restoration of cellular homeostasis [14] . The global improvements in 
volumetric MRI associated with blarcamesine are accompanied by re- 
ducing the decline of clinical disease progression, which suggests the 
drug eÔ¨Äects might be exerted by mitigating neurodegeneration. In con- 
trast, anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies have been associated 
with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E), amyloid- 
related imaging abnormalities-hemorrhages (ARIA-H) and a decrease in 
whole brain volume, i.e. brain atrophy (ARIA-A) compared with placebo 
as well as decreases in other brain regions and a mean increase in ven- 
tricular volume compared with placebo [12,44] . 
Blarcamesine was relatively safe in the study population, with no 
trends of severe or life-threatening and with no associated neuroimag- 
ing adverse events. There were no deaths attributable to blarcamesine 
or placebo. The initially observed early discontinuations and adverse 
events might be related to the timing of the up titration of blarcamesine 
to the target doses coupled with administration at consistent timepoints 
relatively early in the morning as speciÔ¨Åed in the protocol. These events 
can likely be addressed by changing administration to nighttime dosing, 
as has been positively observed in the compassionate use program of 
blarcamesine administration coupled with once daily oral dosing with- 
out requiring reaching the higher target doses. Further evaluation on 
management and reduction of TEAE occurrence will be important. 
This study has some limitations. First, there was variability in to- 
tal blarcamesine doses received and/or duration of blarcamesine dos- 
ing. Second, data collection was for 48 weeks, limiting long-term un- 
derstanding of blarcamesine; however, a 96-week OLE extension study 
(ATTENTION-AD) followed. Third, the studied populations were pri- 
marily White (96.8%), which may limit generalizability to other popula- 
tions due to a lack of racial and ethnic diversity. In order to demonstrate 
eÔ¨Äectiveness in a broader population, future studies will require a more 
diversiÔ¨Åed patient cohort. Fourth, although no related protocol amend- 
ments were necessary, this trial was conducted during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Finally, non-signiÔ¨Åcance of the functional measure ADCS- 
ADL at 48 weeks is considered to be due to the relatively low sensitivity 
of the scale in an early AD population and the relatively short duration 
of the study. 
Blarcamesine, a small molecule administered orally once daily, has 
numerically superior clinical eÔ¨Écacy to approved therapies while also 
slowing neurodegeneration in early AD patients. Blarcamesine has a 
demonstrated safety proÔ¨Åle and does not require routine MRI monitor- 
ing, and given its diÔ¨Äerentiated mechanism of action, could represent a 
novel treatment that is complementary or an alternative to the anti-beta 
amyloid drugs.
